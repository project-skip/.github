## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my pet project; this project is a full redesign and rewrite of the Transit system “Arc” built for the city of Edmonton. 
Being an Edmontonian myself, I know firsthand how god-awful this system is (although it is a better alternative to no system). 
I intend this redesign to be a fully-fledged system with functional card readers, a frontend (maybe an app if I'm feeling adventurous), 
and full scaling, monitoring and security capabilities via my DevOps skills (made possible by a homelab cluster). 
This is to expose the government’s inability to choose adequate development contracts, like the disaster we witnessed with healthcare.gov (and yes Canada is no better). 
Welcome to a humble engineer's attempt at beating the software portion of a 36.5 million dollar contract with the city of Edmonton.
